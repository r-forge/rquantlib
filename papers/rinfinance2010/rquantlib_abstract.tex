\Abstract{
This paper discusses \pkg{RQuantLib} - an R package that connects R and QuantLib. QuantLib is the premier open source library written in \proglang{C++} aimed at provide a comprehensive software framework for quantitative finance. "QuantLib library offers tools that are useful for both practical implementation and for advanced modeling with features such as market conventions, yield curve models, solves, PDEs, Monte Carlo, exotic options, Var and so on." (QuantLib's homepage). It is intended to be used by both practitioners and academics. R is currently the most popular language and environment for statistical computing. Since statistical computing plays a major role in all financial modeling and risk management tasks, it is highly desirable to combine the features and power of R and QuantLib. RQuantLib is a collection of functions for financial tasks such as option pricing, bond pricing, yield curve interpolation whose underlying computation is implemented in QuantLib. The main portion of this paper describes the current overall functionalities of RQuantLib. In the end, we provide a short instruction to interface QuantLib with R using \pkg{Rcpp}.
