2004-09-12  Dirk Eddelbuettel  <edd@debian.org>

	* Release 0.1.10

	* Switched to using Boost library as per QuantLin 0.3.7

        * AmericanOption now uses the Barone-Adesi-Whaley approximation
	
	* Implied volatility for both European and American options
	  currently segfaults when called from R, though the code itself
	  works as standalon. The code also works from R when the implied
	  calculation call is skipped. Something is corrupting memory
	  somewhere. For now, we return NA for either function.

	* DESCRIPTION: Added SystemRequirements for QuantLib

2004-05-26  Dirk Eddelbuettel  <edd@debian.org>

	* Release 0.1.9

	* man/EuropeanOption.Rd: Added corrections for the issues raised
	  by Ajay Shah in the Debian bug report #249240

	* man/{AmericanOption,BarrierOption,BinaryOption}.Rd: Idem

2004-04-05  Dirk Eddelbuettel  <edd@debian.org>

	* Release 0.1.8

	* src/{barrier_binary,implieds,utils,vanilla}.cc: Updated to the 
	  new QuantLib 0.3.5 pricer framework.  This currently implies
	  that options priced using the binomial engines do not have
	  Greeks; this should be addressed in a future QuantLib release.

	* man/{BarrierOption,AmericanOption}.Rd: Note that Greeks are
	  currently unavailable with binary pricers

	  -- split off from RQuantLib.cc
	  -- rewritten functions for implied volatility on European and
	     American options using new QuantLib framework

	  -- split off from RQuantLib.cc

	* src/vanilla.cc
